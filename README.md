# Geographic-Software-Design-Spring-2023-Subtitles-in-Spanish👨‍💻🌍

🗺️🐍📦🌎🌐🌍🌏🚀📝🤝👥💻🌱🔍

This repository contains the Spanish subtitles of the Geographic Software Design Spring 2023 course taught by Dr. Qiusheng Wu. The course will focus on creating and designing open-source Python packages for geospatial analysis and interactive mapping.

Students will be introduced to popular Python IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Colab, and will use these tools to package and share their code with collaborators and the broader Python community. They will also learn to build upon popular geospatial packages and contribute to the open-source community.

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to create their own Python package and accompanying documentation website, which can be freely hosted on GitHub. The practical skills acquired in this course will greatly enhance students' resumes and make them more competitive in the job market for technical positions such as GIS analyst, data scientist, and software developer. The geemap and leafmap Python packages are great examples to follow.
